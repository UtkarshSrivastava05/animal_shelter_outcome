# Animal Shelter Outcome Prediction

This GitHub repository focuses on leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, including XGBoost and neural networks, to predict animal shelter outcomes. By analyzing attributes such as breed, age, health status, intake context, and behavior, we aim to forecast adoption likelihood and length of stay for animals. These predictions serve as the basis for optimizing shelter operations, boosting adoption rates, and improving animal welfare.

## Key Features
* Predicts animal stay duration and adoption likelihood using machine learning models.
* Utilizes a diverse dataset from multiple shelters for training and validation.
* Performance evaluation against accuracy, AUC-ROC, precision, recall, and F1-score benchmarks.
* Aims to reduce length of stay by 15-20% and euthanasia rates by 15-20% through data-driven adoption procedures.
* Potential cost savings of over $200,000 per year for larger shelters.
* Data-driven decision-making for enhanced animal welfare and efficient shelter operations.
* Draws inspiration from successful prognostic models in other domains.

## Motivation
Animal shelters face challenges like overcrowding, extended stays, suboptimal adoptions, and high euthanasia rates. This project addresses these issues through innovative data analysis, predictive modeling, and data-derived recommendations. By harnessing the power of computational technology, we strive to make significant advancements in animal welfare.

## Impact
This initiative combines domain expertise and thorough data analysis to create cutting-edge machine learning models. These models enhance animal shelter outcomes by providing actionable insights for decision-making. Rigorous validation processes and impact tracking ensure that the models meet performance expectations and deliver projected benefits. This project represents a significant step forward in adoption matching, resource management, and overall animal welfare in shelter environments.
